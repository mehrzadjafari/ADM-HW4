# ADM-Homework 4 - Hard coding

**Goal of the homework**: Goal of the homework: write important algorithms and functions from scratch.



## Main Steps:
    > 1. Hashing
    > 2. Clustering
    > 3. Algorithmic Question



## The repository consists of the following files:

1. __`ADM-HW4.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all questions. The notebook consists of outputs, comments, theoretical answers and further explanations.
2. __`hashing_functions.py`__:
    > A Python script containing the hashing functions used in the `ADM-HW3.ipynb` plus useful docstrings for the user.  
3. __`hashing_functions.py`__:
    > A Python script containing the hashing functions used in the `ADM-HW3.ipynb` plus useful docstrings for the user.
